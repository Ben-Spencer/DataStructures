<h2>Lecture 1</h2>
<p>Computers perform built-in and programmer-defined calculations and store results.<br>
Types of Knowledge: Declarative (statement of fact) and Imperative (sequence of steps)<br>
An algorithm is a sequence of steps with a flow of control and a determined stopping point<br>
Basic Machine Architecture: Memory, ALU (primitive operations), Control Unit, Input / Output<br>
Anything computable in one language is computable in every other language<br>
Scalar Object: int, float, complex, bool, bytes, NoneType<br>
Non-Scalar Object: strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and user defined classes<br>
You can use type() to find what type the object is. This is helpful in debugging<br></p>
